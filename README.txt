Hunters4k is an action packed first person shooter written in java.
It was written by Markus Persson as an entry for a java 4KB game programming competition.

-Play-
------

The original .jar is included, but I recommend that you use the updated one.
To launch the original, run "java -cp Hunters4k.jar D window" or execute the "run.bat" file to run the game.
To launch the updated version, all you need to do is double click on the .jar file.
Please note that no matter which version you use, the game will capture your cursor until you exit the game.

-Instructions-
--------------
The goal of Hunters4k is to kill as many hunters as possible before you die.
For every hunter you kill, you gain ten points. Every time you fire your gun, you lose one point.
If a hunter touches you, it will "Blink" you, causing 10 points of damage. When your health reaches 0, the game is over.

-------
-Items-
-------
Walls: They block your passage. Neither you nor the hunters can pass these walls.

Sleeping hunter: Appearing as a closed eye, they will remain in place until shot. Walking into one will still hurt you.

Hunter: Appearing as an open eye, they will reaom the halls when active, looking for ways to hurt you. Shoot a hunter five times to destroy it.

-Source Code-
-------------
The source code included here is decompiled and not the origninal. The original source is gone so please keep in mind that the decompiled source is not exactly accurate to how the game was originally coded (longer, weird variable names, etc.). The point of the decompilation was to produce code that runs, not the exect source code that was originally written.
